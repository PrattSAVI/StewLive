            <p class="intro-text page">
                STEW-MAP is collecting initial information about civic groups and organizations that do environmental stewardship work in your region. These organizations may not primarily focus on the environment, but instead be focused on housing, immigration, social
                services; however, they still engage in caring for the environment in some fashion. This form is to collect basic information on groups' basic contact information, including where each group office or meeting space is located. You can
                enter your own group's information or other groups that you know of or collaborate with. <u>Your participation in STEW-MAP is completely voluntary</u>. At a later stage, groups added to this map may be contacted for the
                full STEW-MAP survey.
                <br><br> By participating in STEW-MAP, you can help potential volunteers, public agencies, funders, and other stewards find your group and learn about what it does. You will also be able to learn about other groups doing stewardship work
                in your region.

            According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to a collection of information unless it displays a valid OMB control number. The valid OMB control number for this information
            collection is 0596-0240. This information will be used to create an assessment of environmental stewardship activities in this community. The time required to complete this information collection is estimated to average 2 minutes for individual
            responses and 15 minutes for multiple responses, including the time for locating and sharing pertinent contact information with us.</p>
